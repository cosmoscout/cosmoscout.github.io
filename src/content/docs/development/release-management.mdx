Releases are [published on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/releases).
They are automatically created via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/actions) whenever a git tag is pushed.
The progress of future releases is tracked with [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/milestones).
Submitted [issues](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/issues) will be assigned to a specific release (depending on their importance and complexity).

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/projects) will be used for high-level planning of complex features, such as network synchronization or photorealistic HDR rendering.

## Version Numbers

Releases in the 1.x.x series will most likely have a lot of breaking API changes, as the software becomes more and more mature.
However, starting from version 2.0.0, version numbers of CosmoScout VR will be assigned according to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.
This means, given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we will increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Creating Releases

When a new version of CosmoScout VR is released, the following steps are performed.

```bash
git checkout main
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

First, the [changelog.md](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/blob/main/docs/changelog.md) has to be updated.
Based on the commits since the last release and the completed milestone, a list of changes is compiled.
When this is done, the file has to be comitted:

```bash
git add docs/changelog.md
git commit -m ":memo: Update changelog.md"
```

Then edit the [project(... VERSION ...)](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt#L8) in the main `CMakeLists.txt` file according to the new version number.
Afterwards, the change has to be comitted:

```bash
git add CMakeLists.txt
git commit -m ":tada: Bump version number"
```

Then we create a new git tag and push this state to the `main` branch.

```bash
git push origin main
git tag v<new version number>
git push origin v<new version number>
```

The default downloads for tags on GitHub do not contain git submodules.
Therefore, a separate archive containing all the submodule code is automatically created via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/actions) when a tag is pushed.
Furthermore, binaries for Windows and Linux are automatically compiled with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/actions) and uploaded to the respective release.
