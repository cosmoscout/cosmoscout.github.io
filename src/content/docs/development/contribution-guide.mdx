title: Write Code for CosmoScout VR
description: Some guidelines for contributing to CosmoScout VR
---

Whenever you encounter a 🪲 **bug** or have 🎉 **feature request**, 
report this via [Github issues](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/issues).

We are happy to receive contributions to CosmoScout VR in the form of **pull requests** via Github.
Feel free to fork the repository, implement your changes and create a merge request to the `main` branch.
There is a [forking guide](#forking-cosmoscout-vr) available to get you started!

## Branching Guidelines

New features and bug fixes are implemented in `feature/*` branches and are merged to `main` once they are finished.
When a milestone is reached, a new tag is created.

:::tip
[Github Actions](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/actions) are used for continuous integration.
All pull requests and pushes to `main` are built automatically.
If you want to test a specific commit on any other branch, add **`[run-ci]`** to your commit message.
:::

## Coding Guidelines

* Each header file should contain an include guard. For CosmoScout VR classes the naming scheme should be `CS_{NAMESPACE}_{FILNAME}_HPP` and for plugins it should be `CSP_{PLUGIN}_{FILNAME}_HPP`.
* Class names should be written in CamelCase (e.g. `MyClass`).
* Class methods should be written in small camelCase (e.g. `doSomething()`). 
* Class members should start with a small `m` and continue in CamelCase (e.g. `mMyClassMember`). 
* Apply clang-format before you create a merge request (either setup your IDE to do this or use the `clang-format.sh` script)
* Never use `using namespace`.
* Use features of modern C++11 / C++14 / C++17 (e.g. range-based for-loops, std::optional, std::variant, ...)!

### Git Commit Messages

Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. __:tada: Add cool new feature__ instead of __:tada: Added cool new feature__).
It's a great idea to start the commit message with an applicable emoji. This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit.
* 🎉 `:tada:` when when adding a cool new feature
* 🔧 `:wrench:` when refactoring / improving a small piece of code
* 🔨 `:hammer:` when refactoring / improving large parts of the code
* ✨ `:sparkles:` when applying clang-format
* 🎨 `:art:` improving / adding assets like textures or 3D-models
* 🚀 `:rocket:` when improving performance
* 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
* 🪲 `:beetle:` when fixing a bug
* 💚 `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
* ✔️ `:heavy_check_mark:` when working on tests
* 🔼 `:arrow_up_small:` when adding / upgrading dependencies
* 🔽 `:arrow_down_small:` when removing / downgrading dependencies
* 🔀 `:twisted_rightwards_arrows:` when merging branches
* 🔥 `:fire:` when removing files
* 🚚 `:truck:` when moving / renaming files or namespaces

:::tip
A good way to enforce this on your side is to use a `commit-hook`. To do this, paste the following script into `.git/hooks/commit-msg`.

```bash title=".git/hooks/commit-msg"
#!/bin/bash

# regex to validate in commit msg
commit_regex='(:(tada|wrench|hammer|sparkles|art|rocket|memo|beetle|green_heart|arrow_up_small|arrow_down_small|twisted_rightwards_arrows|fire|truck|heavy_check_mark):(.+))'
error_msg="Aborting commit. Your commit message is missing an emoji as described in CONTRIBUTING.md"

if ! grep -xqE "$commit_regex" "$1"; then
    echo "$error_msg" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

And make sure that it is executable:

``` bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

# Forking CosmoScout VR

This is pretty straight-forward. Just click the **Fork** button on the top right of this page. Then clone the forked repository, perform your changes, push to a feature branch and create a pull request to CosmoScout's `main` branch.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:<your user name>/cosmoscout-vr.git
cd cosmoscout-vr
git remote add upstream git@github.com:cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr.git
git checkout main
git submodule update --init --recursive
git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature

# ... do and commit your changes!

git push origin feature/your-new-feature
```

When there were changes in CosmoScout's `main` branch, you will need to merge those to your fork before creating a pull request:

``` bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Then you can create a pull request on GitHub to CosmoScout's `main` branch.

## Creating a new plugin

From a git-perspective, this is pretty straight-forward.
All you need to do is creating a new directory in `plugins/`.
For the beginning, you can copy the contents of another similar plugin to that directory.
It will be picked up automatically by the build system.

:::tip
The new directory will also be ignored by git (due to the toplevel `.gitignore` file).
That means that you can use a git repository for your plugin.
