:::note
This page contains generic build instructions for CosmoScout VR. Alternatively, you can follow a [guide specific to your IDE](ide-setup.md).
:::

**CosmoScout VR supports 64 bits only and can be build in debug and release mode on Linux and Windows.
You will need a copy of [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.22 or greater), [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (version 1.69 or greater) and a recent C++ compiler (gcc 7, clang 5 or msvc 19).
For the compilation of the externals [Python](https://www.python.org/) is also required.**

<Steps>

1. ## Downloading External Dependencies

    Before you start, it may be necessary to install some additional system packages.

    <Tabs syncKey='os'>
        <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
            Getting a precompiled version of boost suitable for CosmoScout VR which will be found by CMake can be difficult: Older CMake versions fail to find boost versions which are too new; but on the other hand you need a rather new version if you use a very recent version of MSVC (e.g. 14.2, the one shipped with Visual Studio 2019). The "oldest" precompiled boost which you can get on SourceForge for MSVC 14.2 is version 1.70.0.

            So using version 1.70.0 may work in most cases. You can get it from from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.70.0

            | MSVC | Visual Studio | File                                        | Link                                                                                                                              |
            |------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
            | 14.2 | 2019          | `boost_1_70_0-unsupported-msvc-14.2-64.exe` | [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.70.0/boost_1_70_0-unsupported-msvc-14.2-64.exe/download) |
            | 14.1 | 2017          | `boost_1_70_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe`             | [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.70.0/boost_1_70_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe/download)             |
            | 14.0 | 2015          | `boost_1_70_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe`             | [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.70.0/boost_1_70_0-msvc-14.0-64.exe/download)             |

            :::note
            If you want that CosmoScout VR detects your 3DConnexion Space Navigator, you have to [download](https://3dconnexion.com/de/software-developer-program/) and install the 3DConnexion SDK. Then you need to add one line to the `make_externals.bat` but file as [described here](https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr/blob/main/make_externals.bat#L313).
            :::
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
            As there are many distributions with varying default libs and available packages, giving an exhaustive list is difficult.
            Here is an exemplary list for Ubuntu 20.04 which you have to adapt to your specific distribution:
            
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential xorg-dev libboost-all-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libssl-dev libxkbcommon0
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

2. ## Cloning the Repository

    Once these dependencies are installed, you can clone the repository.
    Open a terminal in a directory where you want to store the source code and execute the following commands:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/cosmoscout/cosmoscout-vr.git
    cd cosmoscout-vr
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

    :::caution[Maximum Path Length on Windows]
    During compilation of the externals, files with pretty long names are generated. Since Windows does not support paths longer 260 letters, you have to compile CosmoScout VR quite close to your file system root (`e.g. C:\cosmoscout-vr`). If you are on Windows 10, [you can disable this limit](https://www.howtogeek.com/266621/how-to-make-windows-10-accept-file-paths-over-260-characters/).
    :::

3. ## Building Bundled Dependencies

    This step only has to be done once.
    It will compile all dependencies which are bundled as git submodules in the `build` directory and install them to the `install` directory.

    :::tip
    If you wish, you can delete the directories `build` and `install` (or their respective subdirectories) at any time in order to force a complete reconfiguration or re-installation.
    :::

    Per default, all dependencies are built in release mode using precompiled headers and unity builds where possible.
    This behavior can be adjusted using some environment variables:

    | Variable                     | Default | Description                                      |
    |------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
    | `COSMOSCOUT_DEBUG_BUILD`     | `false` | Set to `true` to build everything in debug mode. |
    | `COSMOSCOUT_USE_UNITY_BUILD` | `true`  | Set to `false` to disable unity builds.          |
    | `COSMOSCOUT_USE_PCH`         | `true`  | Set to `false` to not use precompiled headers.   |

    You should set these as required before executing the scripts below.

    <Tabs syncKey='os'>
        <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
            If you are using Visual Studio 2017, you have to replace `-G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64` with `-G "Visual Studio 15 Win64"`.
            All parameters given to `make_externals.bat` will be forwarded to CMake. For example, you can change the CMake generator this way.

            ```batch
            make_externals.bat -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64
            ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
            All parameters given to `make_externals.sh` will be forwarded to CMake. For example, you can change the CMake generator this way.
            ```shell
            ./make_externals.sh -G "Unix Makefiles"
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    :::tip[Speed up your Builds!]
    <Tabs syncKey='os'>
        <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
            You can use [clcache](https://github.com/frerich/clcache) to considerably speed up build times. You just need to call `make_externals.bat -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" -DCMAKE_VS_GLOBALS="CLToolExe=clcache.exe;TrackFileAccess=false"`.

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
            You can use [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) to considerably speed up build times. You just need to call `./make_externals.sh -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache`.

4. ## Building CosmoScout VR

    One can either use [CMake Presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.22/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) or build the software manually using CMake. 
    **Using CMake Presets** is easy and definitely the recommended way.

    
    :::note[Setting variables]
    You can override preset variables by simply setting them in the command line after the preset name e.g.:
    ```bash
    cmake --preset <preset-name> -DCOSMOSCOUT_UNIT_TESTS=Off
    cmake --build --preset <preset-name> --parallel 2
    ```
    You can also create your own presets by creating `CMakeUserPresets.json` and inherit from a global preset or define your completely own preset.

            # presets using the following command:

            # After you decided for a preset you can

            # The next step is to build CosmoScout VR.
            # You can also list build presets:
            cmake --build --list-presets

            # After you decided for a preset you can build with the following command:
            cmake --build --preset <preset-name>
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>


    

    :::caution
    Be aware that the configure and build presets need to match!

5. ## Running CosmoScout VR


    <Tabs syncKey='os'>
        <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
            ```batch
            install\windows-Release\bin\start.bat
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
            ```shell
            install/linux-Release/bin/start.sh
            ```
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    The application can be started with the command above.
    When started for the very first time, some example datasets will be downloaded from the internet.
    **This will take some time!**
    The progress of this operation is shown on the loading screen.

6. ## Optional: Running Tests
    
    If you specified `-DCOSMOSCOUT_UNIT_TESTS=On` at build time, you can now execute the unit tests with:
